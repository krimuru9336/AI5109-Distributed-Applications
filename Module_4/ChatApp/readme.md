## Introduction
This is ChatApp, my Android application designed for Distributed Applications, allowing real-time chat between users.

ChatApp is written in Kotlin and utilizes the following technologies:
- Jetpack Compose
- Google Firebase BaaS (Firebase Firestore, Firebase Authentication)
- MVVM architecture pattern (ViewModels, LiveData) (Optimized in future versions)
- Coroutines
- Kotlin Flow
- Kotlin Serialization
- Material 3 Design
- Coil (in future versions)
- Dependency Injection (Hilt) (In future versions)

It is tested through Android API 34 emulators and through physical devices also running Android 14 (Girlfriends' Galaxy S22 because I have an iPhone).

## Prerequisites
To build and run the ChatApp project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development environment:
- Android Studio with Gradle
- Android SDK

To get the backend working, ensure you have created a project in Google Firebase console.
Make sure that you have enabled Firebase Authentication by e-mail and Firebase Firestore.
Register an Android app and download the google-services.json file from Firebase console.

## Installation
1. Clone the ChatApp repository.
2. Paste the google-services.json from Firebase in the /app folder.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an Android emulator or device.

## Features
- User registration and login.
- Chat overview with a list of chat participants.
- Creation of new chats using participants' email address.
- Sending and receiving messages in chat conversations in realtime.
- Editing and deleting already sent messages in realtime.
- Usage of Google Firebase BaaS, which is basically a serverless backend.
- Utilization of Material 3 UI components.

## ViewModels
### RegisterViewModel
The `RegisterViewModel` manages user registration functionality using Firebase Authentication.

### LoginViewModel
The `LoginViewModel` handles user login functionality using Firebase Authentication.

### ChatOverviewViewModel
The `ChatOverviewViewModel` works in conjunction with `ChatViewModel` to handle chat overviews and to start new chats.

### ChatViewModel
The `ChatViewModel` orchestrates chat-related operations, such as sending and receiving messages, utilizing Firebase Firestore.

## UI
The UI is realized through Jetpack Compose in Material 3 design.
Currently, every Composable can be found in MainActivity.kt.

The UI is divided into the following screens, realized through Scaffolds:
### StartScreen
The `StartScreen` is the entry point of the application, providing options for user login or registration.

### RegisterScreen
The `RegisterScreen` allows user registration by capturing email and password information.

### LoginScreen
The `LoginScreen` allows users to log in by entering their registered email and password.

### MainUI
The `MainUI` acts as the central hub, directing users to different sections of the app based on their actions using a NavController.

### MainScaffold
The `MainScaffold` is the main screen of the app, displaying the chat overview and allowing users to start new chats.

### AddChatDialog
The `AddChatDialog` is a modal bottom sheet for adding new chat conversations.

### ChatScaffold
The `ChatScaffold` displays chat conversations, allowing users to send and receive messages.

By clicking on the MessageBubble, you can edit or delete the message using the Message Menu:

## Firebase configuration
### Authentification
Authenticating users is done through Firebase Authentification through e-mail and password.

### Firestore
Firestore is used to store the chat messages and the chat participants.

Chats will be stored in the collection `chats`.
Each chat has a document defined by both chat participants' email addresses.

Each chat document has a subcollection `messages`, in which the messages are stored.
Each message is a document generated by a submitted `MessageEntity` object, consisting of
- `id`: Represents the Firebase Document ID where the message is stored
- `message`: The message text
- `senderEmail`: The sender's email address
- `receiverEmail`: The receiver's email address
- `timestamp`: The timestamp of the message

ChatApp queries these documents and listens to changes in the `messages` subcollection to display the messages in realtime.

## Things I have learned so far writing this app
- Jetpack Compose
- Kotlin language
- Asynchronous programming in Kotlin (Coroutines, Flow)
- Firebase Firestore
- Firebase Authentication
- MVVM architecture pattern in Android
- Kotlin Serialization
- Material 3 Design
- Dependency Injection (Hilt)
- Testing with Emulators
- USB Debugging
- Android Studio functionalities

## Difficulties
- Learning declarative UI programming with Jetpack Compose (Learning syntax and concepts)
- Learning Kotlin language (Differs from the syntax I am used to, very modern language)
- Learning asynchronous programming (Did not do it that much before, on Android it is a must)
- Learning mentioned asynchronous programming especially in Kotlin (Coroutines, Flow -> Very different from C# .NET)
- Learning Firebase Firestore (Lots of new concepts to learn and a lots of documentation to read through, especially about queries and those listeners in combination with asynchronous programming)
- Applying MMVM architecture pattern in Android (Only knew it in C# .NET with WPF and Bindings)
