# RippleChat Application Readme

## Project Overview

Ripplechat is a feature-rich chat application designed for seamless user registration, login, and real-time text-based communication. The project follows standard Android application development practices and incorporates Firebase for backend services.

## Features

### User Registration

New users can easily register by providing essential details such as username, email, and password. The information is securely stored in Firebase for future logins.

### User Login

Users can log in using their registered credentials. Firebase authentication is utilized to verify the entered information, granting access to the chat interface upon successful login.

### Chat Messaging

Once logged in, users can engage in real-time text-based conversations. Firebase Realtime Database is employed to store and retrieve chat messages. Note that this version currently supports text messages only.

### Editing and Deleting Messages

Users have the ability to edit their previously sent messages within a certain time frame to correct mistakes or update information. Additionally, users can delete messages they have sent to remove them from the conversation thread.

### Multimedia Support

Enriching the messaging experience, Ripplechat supports multimedia elements such as videos and GIFs in messages, allowing users to share various media types.

### Group Chat

Extended the application to support group chat functionality, enabling multiple users to participate in a single conversation thread. The group chat feature also includes multimedia support, allowing users to share various media types within group conversations. Moreover, the application facilitates capturing pictures from the camera directly within the chat interface for enhanced multimedia sharing capabilities.
