# AI5109-Distributed-Applications

This is the BMI calculator application we developed over the last few exercises.
The difference in this version is the removal of thymeleaf and the deployment of the frontend on a seperate server 
running nginx.
To realise this, the spring boot application needed to be adjusted.


## Deployment

1. VM for Frontend, using Nginx


2. VM for Backend, running the Spring Boot Application


3. Azure MySQL flexible server, with a preinstalled MySQL server
