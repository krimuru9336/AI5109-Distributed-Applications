## Week 1 & 2: Basic Springboot 

### Task Description

The goal of this project task is to integrate a front end with a backend and a database. The specific requirements are outlined below.

### Front End Requirements

1. Input form:

2. Display Container:
	- Include a small div or table to display contents retrieved from the database.
	
### Backend Requirements

1. Data Submission:
	- Implement backend functionality to receive data from the frontend and store it in the database.
2. Data Retrieval:
	- Implement backend functionality to retrieve data from the database and send it to the frontend.
	
### Database Requirements

1. Database Setup:
	- Set up MySQL Workbench or a similar database system.
2. Record Display:
	- Implement functionality to display records from the database.
	
### Project Workflow

1. Frontend-Backend Communication:
	- Ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend for data submission and retrieval.
2. Database Integration:
	- Integrate the database into the backend to store and retrieve data efficiently.
3. Dependencies:
	- For getting the dependencies, visit [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) and select the desired dependencies for your project.


## Week 3: Calling an API

### Task Description

The second task involves calling an API from your application. You have the flexibility to choose any API for this task.
If you need suggestions, you can explore the [public APIs repository](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

### API Selection

For this task, I chose to call the [Tomorrow.io API](https://docs.tomorrow.io/reference/welcome). This API provides weather-related data and services.
