#  üò∫ Cat BMI Calculation application

This is a Java Spring Boot application for Body Mass Index (BMI) calculations of cats. It can be used as one of many measures to check how in shape your cat is.

The BMI is calculated based on measurements taken at the circumference around the level of the 9th rib and the length of the lower back leg from knee to ankle. 
Further details can be found [here](https://worldanimalfoundation.org/cats/bmi-calculator/).
