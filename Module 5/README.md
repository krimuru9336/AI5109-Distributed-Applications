# Ripplechat Application Readme

## Project Overview

Ripplechat is a feature-rich chat application designed for seamless user registration, login, and real-time text-based communication. The project follows standard Android application development practices and incorporates Firebase for backend services.

## Features

### 1. User Registration

- **XML Layout File:** `res/layout/registeractivity.xml`
- **Java File:** `src/main/java/com/example/yourpackage/RegisterActivity.java`

  New users can easily register by providing essential details such as username, email, and password. The information is securely stored in Firebase for future logins.

### 2. User Login

- **XML Layout File:** `res/layout/loginactivity.xml`
- **Java File:** `src/main/java/com/example/yourpackage/LoginActivity.java`

  Users can log in using their registered credentials. Firebase authentication is utilized to verify the entered information, granting access to the chat interface upon successful login.

### 3. Chat Messaging

- **XML Layout File:** `res/layout/messageactivity.xml`
- **Java File:** `src/main/java/com/example/yourpackage/MessageActivity.java`

  Once logged in, users can engage in real-time text-based conversations. Firebase Realtime Database is employed to store and retrieve chat messages. Note that this version currently supports text messages only.

## Project Structure
